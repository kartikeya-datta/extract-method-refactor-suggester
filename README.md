# extract-method-refactor-suggester
Here I am intending to make a model using which we can optimize the java code by looking for extract method refactoring opportunities in Java code using Code Property Graphs (CPGs) and multi-view graph embeddings.



# Extract Method Refactor Suggester

A machine learning-based project to detect and recommend Extract Method refactoring opportunities in Java code using Code Property Graphs (CPGs) and multi-view graph embeddings.

## Structure
- data/: Input Java code and datasets
- embeddings/: CPG-based code embeddings
- scripts/: Parsing and processing scripts
- models/: ML model training/evaluation
- notebooks/: Exploratory analysis
- results/: Visualizations, evaluation outputs

## Status
ðŸ”§ Work in progress. Stay tuned!
